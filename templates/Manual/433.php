By building a palisade, you can protect your village against the barbarian hordes of your enemies. The higher its level, the higher is the bonus given to your forces' defence.
<br/><br/>
The palisade can only be built by Gauls, its defence bonus and its durability is between that of the Teutonic earth wall and the Roman city wall.
